Content: Annual electricity generation (GWh) falling as turbines reach end-of-life.

Add a cumulative cash flow box at the bottom (total revenue over asset life).

Bottom caption: assumptions (average power price £65/MWh, O&M costs ~10%, management fees, etc.).

Cash Flow Statement (2024 & H1 2025)

Chart Type: Sankey (like your screenshot).

Flows: Operating cash inflow → Investing outflow → Financing (debt/dividends) → Net change in cash.

Show month-to-month electricity generation (GWh) with green/yellow lines.

Add a horizontal red line = long-term average.

Annotate “calm years” (e.g. 2024, below-average) vs windy years.

UK Electricity Market Pricing (Marginal Pricing Mechanism)

Chart Type: Supply/Demand curve with price set by gas.
